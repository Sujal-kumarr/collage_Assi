        <h1>Problem 1: Two Sum</h1>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.</p>
        <p>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>We can use a hash map (or a dictionary in Python) to solve this in one pass. As we iterate through the array, we will store each number and its index in the map.</p>
        <p>For each number `x`, we will check if the "complement" (`target - x`) already exists in the map. If it does, we have found our two numbers and can return their indices.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <pre class="code-block">
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
        </pre>

        <h2>Solution (Python)</h2>
        <p>This is the solution in Python. You can select and copy the code from the block below.</p>
        
        <pre class="code-block"><code>
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        # A hash map to store seen numbers and their indices
        seen = {} 
        
        # enumerate gives us both the index (i) and the value (num)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            
            # Check if the complement is already in our map
            if complement in seen:
                # If yes, return the current index and the complement's index
                return [seen[complement], i]
            
            # If not, add the current number to the map
            seen[num] = i
        
        # If no solution is found (though problem guarantees one)
        return []
